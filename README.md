//Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming room is a gaming company that wanted a game called darw it or lose it, that has players competing to solve puzzles based off of stock photos.

//What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The recommondations section, I went through and looked at pricing and effiecency for diffrent cloud based services and took my time finding the best one for the problem at hand.

//What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It creates a step by step template, you can visualize how classes link and how each funtion of the program works in conjunction.

//If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The design constaints was not very detailed and worded not very well. It lacks substanance.

//How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The users needs is the most important when making the design, which makes the documentation for the design so much more important because you can create a visual representation of what is going to be made. Which would be a game that uses stock images, that are used in a way to create puzzles that teams use to compete.

//How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Methodically, creating a UML was the first step to visualizing the design for the code, then create the classes needed for the program and then link the classes to be used in functions. Really the best strategy is to work in blocks/units seperate from one another.
